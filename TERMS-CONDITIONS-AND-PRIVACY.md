## Terms & Conditions

### 1) Who We Are

"EXOCHAIN Foundation," "we," "us," and "our" refer to **EXOCHAIN Foundation DAO LLC**, a decentralized autonomous organization formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Wyoming, USA, pursuant to the Wyoming Decentralized Autonomous Organization Supplement (W.S. 17-31-101 et seq.).

These Terms govern your access to and use of this website and related EXOCHAIN Foundation-operated services, applications, repositories, APIs, smart contracts, governance interfaces, and community spaces that link to these Terms (collectively, the "Services").

**DAO Notice (Required by Wyoming Law):** The rights of members in a decentralized autonomous organization may differ materially from the rights of members in other limited liability companies. The EXOCHAIN Foundation DAO LLC is governed by its Articles of Organization, Operating Agreement, and applicable smart contracts, which may define, reduce, or eliminate fiduciary duties and restrict transfer of ownership interests, withdrawal, resignation, or return of capital contributions.

### 2) The Services (What These Terms Cover)

To clarify scope, the Services typically fall into four categories:

1. **Website and documentation** — informational content, posts, pages, specifications, legal pages
2. **Open-source repositories** — code, specs, issues, pull requests, governance proposals
3. **Hosted services** — accounts, dashboards, APIs, portals, rate-limited endpoints
4. **Public-network interactions** — cryptographic proofs, transaction submissions, wallet-based actions, on-chain governance

These Terms apply across all categories unless a specific service states otherwise.

### 3) Acceptance of These Terms

By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization, and "you" includes that organization.

### 4) Changes to the Services and These Terms

We're building. The Services may change, improve, or be retired at any time.

We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top shows when changes were made. If you continue using the Services after an update, you're agreeing to the updated Terms.

**Material changes:** If a change is materially adverse, we may provide additional notice (such as a banner or in-product notification), but we are not obligated to do so unless required by law.

**Smart contract upgrades:** Certain Services may rely on smart contracts that can be updated, modified, or upgraded pursuant to our governance processes. You acknowledge that such upgrades may change functionality, and continued use after an upgrade constitutes acceptance.

### 5) Eligibility and Restricted Persons

You must be able to form a legally binding contract in your jurisdiction to use the Services. If you are under the age of majority where you live, you may use the Services only with the consent and involvement of a parent or legal guardian.

**You may not use the Services if you are:**

- Located in, or a resident of, any jurisdiction subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions (currently including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions, as amended)
- Listed on any U.S. government prohibited party list (including OFAC's SDN List)
- Otherwise prohibited by applicable law from using the Services

### 6) Your Account, Keys, and Security

Some parts of the Services may allow you to create an account or authenticate using third-party providers and/or cryptographic wallets.

**You are responsible for:**

- Maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and private keys
- All activity that occurs under your account or wallet
- Keeping your account information accurate

If you believe your account or keys have been compromised, notify us promptly at security@exochain.foundation.

**Wallet reality check:** If you use a wallet, you control your keys. We cannot recover lost keys, reverse unauthorized transactions, or undo actions committed to public networks.

### 7) Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Services in a lawful, respectful, and security-conscious way.

**You may not:**

- Break the law or encourage others to do so
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems, accounts, or data
- Probe, scan, or test vulnerabilities without explicit written permission (see Section 7A)
- Interfere with or disrupt the Services (including by overloading, spamming, scraping at harmful volumes, or introducing malware)
- Reverse engineer or circumvent access controls except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by law
- Use the Services to build, train, or deploy systems intended for harm, fraud, surveillance abuse, manipulation, or deception
- Use the Services in any manner that could undermine AI safety or alignment objectives
- Impersonate another person or misrepresent your affiliation
- Engage in market manipulation, wash trading, or fraudulent schemes involving any tokens or digital assets associated with the Services
- Circumvent geographic restrictions or sanctions compliance measures

We may suspend or terminate access if we believe you have violated these Terms or pose a security, legal, or integrity risk.

#### 7A) Security Research and Responsible Disclosure

We welcome responsible security research conducted in good faith.

**If you believe you've found a vulnerability:**

- Email security@exochain.foundation with a clear description and reproduction steps
- Avoid accessing or downloading data you don't own or have permission to access
- Avoid actions that degrade service availability for others
- Give us a reasonable opportunity to remediate (typically 90 days) before public disclosure

**Out of scope (without explicit written permission):** Social engineering, credential stuffing, denial-of-service, physical attacks, or attempts to access private user data.

If you follow these rules and act in good faith, we will not pursue legal action solely for your research. We may, at our discretion, publicly acknowledge researchers.

### 8) Community Spaces, Submissions, and Open-Source Contributions

If you post, upload, submit, publish, or otherwise make content available through the Services (including in forums, issue trackers, pull requests, governance proposals, or other collaboration channels), you remain responsible for your content.

You represent that you have the rights needed to submit the content and that it does not violate the law or the rights of others.

**Open-source licensing:** Contributions to public repositories are governed by the LICENSE and contribution rules in the relevant repository. Code contributions require acceptance of our Contributor License Agreement (see Section 10).

### 9) Intellectual Property and Trademarks

We and our licensors own the Services and all associated intellectual property, except for:

- Content you provide (which you retain, subject to the licenses below), and
- Open-source components that are governed by their own licenses (primarily Apache License 2.0)

**Trademarks and brand:** The names "EXOCHAIN," "EXOCHAIN Foundation," "AEGIS," and associated logos and brand features are protected. You may not use them in a way that suggests endorsement or affiliation without permission. Nominative and descriptive fair use is generally allowed.

**Apache 2.0 licensed code:** Substantial portions of our codebase are released under the Apache License 2.0. Your use of such code is governed by that license. Nothing in these Terms restricts rights granted under open-source licenses.

### 10) Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Code contributions** to EXOCHAIN Foundation repositories require acceptance of our Contributor License Agreement. By submitting a pull request or patch, you agree to the following:

#### 10A) Definitions

"Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including modifications or additions to existing work, that you intentionally submit to us for inclusion in the Services or related projects. "Submit" means any form of communication sent to us, including pull requests, patches, issues, and comments, but excluding communications conspicuously marked "Not a Contribution."

#### 10B) Grant of Copyright License

You grant to EXOCHAIN Foundation DAO LLC and to recipients of software distributed by us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

#### 10C) Grant of Patent License

You grant to EXOCHAIN Foundation DAO LLC and to recipients of software distributed by us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

#### 10D) Representations

You represent that:

- You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses
- If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or your employer has waived such rights
- Each Contribution is your original creation (see below for third-party submissions)
- Your Contribution does not include any third-party code except as clearly identified and licensed under compatible terms

#### 10E) Third-Party Submissions

If you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you may submit it separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and any license or other restriction, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]."

#### 10F) No Obligation; Downstream Licensing

We are under no obligation to use or incorporate your Contribution. Contributions may be released under the Apache License 2.0 or another open-source license selected by us, and may also be incorporated into commercial or proprietary offerings.

**Signing:** By submitting a pull request, you indicate acceptance of this CLA. For significant contributions, we may request a signed CLA on file.

### 11) License to Operate the Services (Your Content)

If you provide content to the Services (for example, feedback, bug reports, governance proposals, community posts, or support messages), you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify (for formatting, safety, and compatibility), create derivative works from, publicly display, and distribute that content for the purpose of operating, improving, and securing the Services.

This license does not transfer ownership of your content.

### 12) Experimental and Emerging Technology Notice

Some functionality may involve cryptography, decentralized networks, smart contracts, verifiable logs, artificial intelligence systems, and experimental governance mechanisms. These technologies can behave in unexpected ways.

**You understand and agree that:**

- Transactions and records on public networks may be public and persistent
- We may not be able to reverse, delete, or undo actions that occur on public networks
- Software, protocols, and smart contracts may be upgraded or changed pursuant to governance processes
- AI systems may produce unexpected outputs or behave in ways that differ from expectations
- Security issues can occur despite best efforts
- Network congestion, bugs, or external factors may cause delays or failures

**No guarantee of outcomes:** The AEGIS framework and related AI governance tools are experimental. We do not guarantee that they will achieve any particular safety, alignment, or governance outcome.

### 13) No Financial Advice; No Solicitation

Nothing in the Services is financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. The Services are not an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy securities or other regulated instruments in any jurisdiction.

**Governance tokens:** If EXOCHAIN Foundation issues governance tokens or similar instruments:

- They are intended solely for participation in governance and access to Services
- They are not intended as investments and should not be purchased with any expectation of profit
- Their value, if any, may fluctuate or become zero
- Regulatory treatment varies by jurisdiction; you are responsible for understanding applicable laws

**Utility access:** Any credits, tokens, or payment mechanisms associated with the Services are intended for utility access (such as paying for hosted services or computational resources) rather than investment.

### 14) No Medical Advice; High-Stakes and Regulated Use

The Services are not medical devices and do not provide medical, clinical, legal, or other professional advice.

**High-stakes use:** If the Services are used in regulated or high-stakes contexts (healthcare, clinical research, emergency response, critical infrastructure, autonomous systems, etc.), that use:

- May require separate agreements and additional controls
- Must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and professional standards
- Is at your sole risk

**AI governance in critical systems:** If you use the AEGIS framework or related tools in systems that affect human safety, you are solely responsible for appropriate human oversight, testing, validation, and compliance.

Do not rely on the Services as your sole source of truth for life-critical decisions.

### 15) Third-Party Services and Links

The Services may link to third-party websites or integrate third-party tools (for example, hosting providers, analytics, identity providers, blockchain networks, oracles, or code repositories). We are not responsible for third-party content, policies, or practices.

Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms. Blockchain networks, in particular, operate independently and are not controlled by us.

### 16) Disclaimers

**THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE."**

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, and quiet enjoyment.

**We do not warrant that:**

- The Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure
- Smart contracts will execute as expected in all circumstances
- AI systems will behave as anticipated
- Governance mechanisms will produce any particular outcome
- Data on decentralized networks will remain available or accurate

**Assumption of risk:** You acknowledge that decentralized technologies, cryptographic systems, and AI systems carry inherent risks, including total loss of assets, data, or access. You assume all such risks.

### 17) Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, EXOCHAIN Foundation DAO LLC and its members, contributors, officers, directors, contractors, and licensors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, data, goodwill, tokens, digital assets, or other intangible losses, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Services.

This limitation applies regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise) and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total aggregate liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Services will not exceed the greater of:

- The amount you paid us (if any) for the Services in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim, or
- One hundred U.S. dollars ($100)

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in that case, these limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.

### 18) Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EXOCHAIN Foundation DAO LLC and its members, affiliates, contributors, officers, directors, contractors, and licensors from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:

- Your use of the Services
- Your content or Contributions
- Your violation of these Terms
- Your violation of any rights of another
- Your violation of applicable law
- Any claim that your Contributions infringe intellectual property or other rights of any third party

### 19) Termination

You may stop using the Services at any time.

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time if we reasonably believe:

- You violated these Terms
- Your use creates risk to the Services, other users, or the public
- We are required to do so by law or to comply with sanctions

**Effect on-chain:** Termination of your access to our hosted Services does not affect transactions or records already committed to public networks, which may persist indefinitely.

Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution) will survive.

### 20) Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

#### 20A) Informal Resolution First

Before initiating formal dispute resolution, you agree to contact legal@exochain.foundation and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least 30 days. Most disputes can be resolved this way.

#### 20B) Binding Arbitration

If we cannot resolve the dispute informally, **you and EXOCHAIN Foundation DAO LLC agree to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services through binding arbitration**, rather than in court, except that either party may bring claims in small claims court if they qualify.

**Arbitration rules:** Arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as modified by these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The seat of arbitration will be Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA, but hearings may be conducted remotely.

**Arbitrator authority:** The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes, including whether the dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award, including injunctive relief.

**Arbitration fees:** Each party will pay its own arbitration fees as required by JAMS rules. If you cannot afford arbitration fees, you may request that we pay them, and we will consider such requests in good faith.

**Confidentiality:** Arbitration proceedings and awards will be confidential, except as required by law or to enforce the award.

#### 20C) Class Action Waiver

**YOU AND EXOCHAIN FOUNDATION DAO LLC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.**

The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.

#### 20D) Exceptions

Notwithstanding the above:

- Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened infringement of intellectual property rights or to protect confidential information or system integrity
- Claims related to the enforcement of arbitration awards may be brought in court
- If the class action waiver is found unenforceable, the entire arbitration agreement will be void, and disputes will proceed in court

#### 20E) Opt-Out

You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to legal@exochain.foundation within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name, address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out, you and we may litigate disputes in court.

### 21) Governing Law and Venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, USA, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.

Where arbitration is not permitted by law or does not apply, disputes will be brought in the state or federal courts located in Wyoming, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

### 22) Export Control and Sanctions

The Services may be subject to U.S. export control and sanctions laws. You agree to comply with all applicable export and sanctions laws and regulations. You may not use, export, or re-export the Services except as authorized by U.S. law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Services were obtained.

### 23) Force Majeure

We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside our reasonable control, including acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, pandemics, network infrastructure failures, blockchain network failures or congestion, or widespread cyberattacks.

### 24) Corrections

There may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions. We reserve the right to correct any errors and to update information at any time without prior notice.

### 25) Entire Agreement and Severability

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other policies or agreements referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and EXOCHAIN Foundation DAO LLC regarding the Services.

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, or severed if modification is not possible, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms is not a waiver of that provision or our right to enforce it later.

### 26) Assignment

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction.

- Incident response procedures

However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure. You use the Services at your own risk. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own credentials and private keys.

You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

### 11) International Data Transfers

If you access the Services from outside the U.S., your information may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the U.S. and other countries where our service providers operate. These countries may have different data protection laws than your jurisdiction.

Where required by law, we use appropriate safeguards for international transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

### 12) Children's Privacy

The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under these ages.
